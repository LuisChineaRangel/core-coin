## About the Project

This project was born to find a solution for the coins change problem using greedy algorithms. There were added custom functions added to modify the types of coins used, show the last change calculated and precision measurements to control float numbers data loss.

### Built With

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* g++
  ```sh
  apt install g++
  ```
* make
  ```sh
  apt install make
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LuismGH/Money-Change
   ```
2. Compile
   ```sh
   make
   ```
3. Execute
   ```sh
   make run
   ```
## Usage

Once launched, it will display an interactive menu with all the program features:

* Calculate the change for a requested amount
* Show last change
* View all coin types availables
* Insert new coins to the algorithm
* Exit
